<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.elkner.net/">Jeff Elkner</a> is a Computer Science teacher in Arlington, Virginia who authored
the extremely popular Python conversion of the book "How to Think Like a Computer
Scientist". We had the privilege to sit down with him and discuss some of the ways
he uses Python and what he thinks makes it a great language.</p>

<h2>How did you become a programmer?</h2>
<blockquote>
I have a masters degree in Computer Science, but my background is practical as
I am a teacher and never really worked in industry. I started as a math teacher
in the 1990's, and quickly got hooked on computers and information technology.
At the time, the computer teacher was the math teacher who had a computer hobby.
I was that guy and loved it. I then pursued a masters in Computer Science and
since then I have been a full time CS and IT teacher. I first fell in love with
computers because I am somewhat dyslexic, and I had such a difficult time with writing.
The word processor was liberation for me, and I loved writing when I found the word processor.</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="why-did-you-choose-python">
<h2>Why did you choose Python?</h2>
<blockquote>
Pascal was the lingua franca of teaching, but in the late 1990's the college board
switched from Pascal to C++ and that was a disaster. C++ has been very successful
professionally, but it was extremely difficult to use as a teaching language.
At the time, there were no standard classes and the college board actually had
to introduce a standard template library, called the AP classes, for students.
However, that meant when we went to a programming competition, the students couldn't
write a simple program because they couldn't use the AP classes. It was a very
different world then, and I desperately wanted something besides C++. I was looking
for anything and found Python. I don't have any proof of this, but in '99 I might
have been the first high school teacher to use Python in the classroom. It started
in 1995 when Python had been recommended to me at a Linux install-fest, and when
C++ came out I remembered that conversation, tried Python, and have been hooked
ever since. The language brought my to Python, but the community kept me there.
It is a wonderful, inclusive, and welcoming group.</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="what-other-programming-languages-do-you-use">
<h2>What other programming languages do you use?</h2>
<blockquote>
I have to use Java. The AP exam has moved on to Java from C++ and so I need to
teach Java. I am now getting into JavaScript as well. Things are changing and
it is probably time to look at another system programming language as well.</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="what-has-been-your-favorite-python-project">
<h2>What has been your favorite Python project?</h2>
<blockquote>
The thing I love about Python the most is that students can contribute.
I am a teacher in Arlington, VA and  it is a highly educated place. 65% of the
residents have graduate degrees here. The students in the public school vary,
but we get a lot of high-end students and I think what to do with them. Most
students are average, and struggle with things like programming logic. But I
always get a couple students that can complete the entire course in a month.
I love dealing with students like that and the Python community makes it
possible to hook them up with real world projects.
We have a great Linux User Group (LUG) and have had many notable groups like
IBM and people like Vint Cerf visit over the years. One of my students helped
win a competition to have Red Hat visit our LUG by writing a Python script
that asked the Red Hat team if they were coming to visit our LUG. If you didn't
pick our LUG, the script returned a fake traceback error with all the reasons
to come to our LUG.</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="what-is-your-favorite-python-module">
<h2>What is your favorite Python module?</h2>
<blockquote>
GASP. Graphics API for Students of Python. This is a set of wrappers around TK
that some of my students wrote. GASP allowed you to do procedural style programming
and recreate some of the 1980's style arcade games like Pong and Breakout.
You could populate the world with objects, then hit an event loop and play the game.
Most importantly, the students loved it! It made it possible to do easy graphics,
and back then it was a wonderful thing.</blockquote>
